# 🚀 Render.com Deployment Guide

## ✅ Ready for Deployment!

Your reconciliation tool is fully prepared for Render deployment with all configurations optimized.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**

1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   cd "claude card reco tool"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Ready for Render deployment"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - Name it something like `card-reconciliation-tool`
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/card-reconciliation-tool.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### **Step 2: Deploy on Render**

1. **Sign Up/Login**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up with GitHub account (recommended)

2. **Create New Web Service**
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select your `card-reconciliation-tool` repository

3. **Configure Deployment Settings**
   ```
   Name: card-reconciliation-tool
   Region: Choose closest to your users
   Branch: main
   Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
   Start Command: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
   ```

4. **Choose Plan**
   - **Free Plan**: $0/month (sleeps after 15 min inactivity)
   - **Starter Plan**: $7/month (always on, better performance)

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Render will automatically detect your `render.yaml` configuration
   - Deployment takes 2-5 minutes

## 🔧 Your Optimized Configuration

### **render.yaml** (Auto-detected)
```yaml

  - type: web
    name: card-reco-tool
    env: python
    plan: free
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
    envVars:
      - key: PYTHON_VERSION
        value: 3.11.7

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

1. **Build Fails**
